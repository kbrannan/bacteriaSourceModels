Title: Models for estimation of bacteria loads  from several sources
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Kevin Brannan
Maintainer: Kevin Brannan <brannan.kevin@deq.state.or.us>
Description: Models estimate bacteria load from a source over a year. 
    Endpoints of the bacteria load include land surface, directly-to-stream, 
    storage (manure for agriculturla sources), and die-off. The models 
    do not simulate transport of the bacteria via runoff or any other 
    hydrologic process. We developed the models for use with PEST and HSPF.
